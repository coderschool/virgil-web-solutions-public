# M2.3 State Management with Redux

1. What is Redux used for in React?

- [x] Manage states.
- [ ] Manage UI rendering
- [ ] Manage application's logic.
- [ ] All of the above answers.

2. What are the three principles of Redux?

- [x] Single source of truth: States of your application will be represented as an object and stored in a single `store`.
- [x] States are read-only: You can't modify state directly – the only way to change state is to dispatch an action.
- [x] Changes are made with pure functions: Reducer or a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, then return the new state.
- [ ] None of the above answers.

3. With Redux Toolkit, `action.js` and `reducer.js` are now packed in `slice.js`.

- [x] TRUE
- [ ] FALSE

4. In `slice.js`, you will need the function `createSlice()`. Which is the structure of the slice object passed into the function?

- [x] A
- [ ] B
- [ ] Both A and B
- [ ] None of the answer above.

5. Given the below block of code. `state.userName` means you are selecting `userName` in the `initialState`.

- [ ] TRUE
- [x] FALSE

6. Given the below block of code and the button that dispatch the action. What is `action.payload` ?
   `<Button onClick={() => dispatch(changeUserName(userInput))} />`

![](https://i.imgur.com/S2tv90Q.png)

- [x] `action.payload` is the argument passed into changeUserName.
- [x] `action.payload` is `userInput`.
- [ ] `action.payload` is the initial state of the application.
- [ ] `action.payload` is the current state of the application.

7. Given the below block of code. Please fill in the AsyncThunk function's name, and `slice.name`

```javascript=
export const "Your Code Here" = createAsyncThunk(
    "book/fetchData",
    async (props) => {
      const response = await fetchBooks(props);
      return response.data;
        }
);

export const bookSlice = createSlice({
  name: "Your Code Here",
  initialState,
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchData.pending, (state) => {
        state.status = "loading";
      })
      .addCase(fetchData.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.status = null;
        state.books = action.payload;
      })
      .addCase(fetchData.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.status = "failed";
      });
    }
  })
```

- [x] `fetchData` `book`
- [ ] `bookData` `bookSlice`
- [ ] `bookFetch` `bookSlice`
- [ ] All of the above answers.

8. In Redux Tookit, `createAsyncThunk()` is used for fetching data from API and storing response in Redux states. How is an AsyncThunk added to the slice object?

- [x] With the key `extraReducers`
- [ ] With the key `reducers`
- [ ] With the key `addCase`
- [ ] With the key `builder`

9. Given the below block of code, there are still a few lines of missing code. Fill in with the correct code.

```javascript=
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {fetchData} from "../features/bookSlice.js"
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
function App() {
    //Your code here
    //Your code here

useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(fetchData())
},[dispatch])

return (
  <div> {books} </div>
 )
}
```

- [x] `const books = useSelector((state) => state.book.books);`
- [ ] `const books = useDispatch()`
- [x] `const dispatch = useDispatch()`
- [ ] `const selector = useSelector()`

10. You will need to export `slice.reducer` in `slice.js` and import to `store.js` to add to the reducer into your `store`.

- [x] TRUE
- [ ] FALSE

12. In Redux Toolkit, `configureStore()` is the function used to create the `store`.

- [x] TRUE
- [ ] FALSE

13. In Redux Toolkit, to add more than one reducer, you don't need the helper function `combineReducers()`

- [x] TRUE
- [ ] FALSE

```javascript=
<Button onClick={() => dispatch(changeUserName(userInput))} />
```

```javascript=
const initialState = {
    userName: '',
}
const userSlice = creatSlice({
    name: 'user',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        changeUserName: (state,action) => {
            state.userName = atcion.payload.text;
        },
    },
});
```
