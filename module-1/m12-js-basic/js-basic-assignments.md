 Â°F to Â°C
  Given the function fToC(fDegree) , try and fix it so that it correctly converts Fahrenheit degree (Â°F) to Celsius degree (Â°C).
  (Â°F âˆ’ 32) Ã— 5/9 = Â°C
  function fToC (fDegree) {
	const cDegree = (fDegree - 32 * 5 / 9)
	return cDegree
}

 Body Type from BMI
 Write a function to check your body type base on weight and height. Known that:
  BMI = weight in kg/(height in m)^2
  
Check the BMI, if BMI is:
less than 18: underweight
18 to less than 25: normal weight
25 to less than 30: overweight
30 and above: obesity
Return the right body type.

Examples:

bodyType(1.64,60) should return "normal weight"

bodyType(1.6,70) should return "overweight"
  
  function bodyType (height, weight) {
	//YOUR CODE HERE	
}
  ````
  
##  Answer:
````
function bodyType (height, weight) {
	//YOUR CODE HERE
	const bmi = weight / (height * height)
  
	if(bmi <18) return "underweight";
	else if(bmi <25) return "normal weight";
	else if(bmi <30) return "overweight";
	else return "obesity";

 Count Your Calories
 You are on a diet and record your total calorie intake every day.
 After a week, the 7 numbers are recorded in an array. 
 Calculate your total weight gain or loss for the week if you burn 
 2000 calories a day, and 1 kg is equivalent to 7700 calories.
  
 NOTE: 1 kg = 7700 calories
  
 Examples:
totalKcal([1600, 1600, 1500, 1700, 1800, 2000, 2000]) // should return - 0.233766234, meaning you will lose 0.233766234 kg
totalKcal([2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000]) // should return 0
  
  function totalKcal(arr) {
	let result = 0;
	// YOUR CODE HERE
	return result;
}
  
  ````
  
##  Answer:
````
function totalKcal(arr) {
	let result = 0;
	// YOUR CODE HERE
	for(i = 0; i<arr.length;i++)
	{
	    result += (arr[i]-2000)/7700
	}
	

	return result

Yard Sale
  
You are moving to a new place and having a yard sale. You make a list of all the items and their corresponding prices. Calculate the total money in VND you can earn if you sell all the items.
For example:
  const items = [{
        name: "table",
        price: 100000,
        currency: "VND"
    },
    {
        name: "microwave",
        price: 700000,
        currency: "VND"
    },
    {
        name: "sofa",
        price: 500000,
        currency: "VND"
    }
]

function totalPrice(arr) {
let total = 0
	//YOUR CODE HERE
return total
}
  ````
  
##  Answer:
````
function totalPrice(arr) {
let total = 0
	//YOUR CODE HERE
	for(i = 0; i<arr.length ; i++)
	{
	    total += arr[i].price
	}
	
return total
